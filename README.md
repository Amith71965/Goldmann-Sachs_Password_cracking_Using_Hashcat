# Goldmann-Sachs_Password_cracking_Using_Hashcat
Cracked nearly 20 Hashed password using Hashcat as a tool

This repository contains the implementation of Hashcat to crack the hashed password leaked from Goldman Sachs. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how vulnerable hashed passwords can be and to raise awareness about the importance of strong password protection measures.

The repository includes the leaked hashed password file and the corresponding salt, along with the Hashcat implementation to decrypt the password. The implementation involves the use of brute force attacks to decrypt the hashed password.

This project serves as a reminder to individuals and organizations to implement strong password policies and to use hashing algorithms that are resistant to brute force attacks. By sharing this project, I hope to encourage the wider community to take password protection more seriously and to take proactive measures to enhance the security of their systems.
